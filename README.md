# C# API Development 
- Backend Development
- COMPSCI 335
  

> This repository contains **two assignments** completed as part of the **COMPSCI 335** course at the University of Auckland.  
> The focus is on **API development** using **C# and .NET 8 Framework**, following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture** for structured and maintainable development.

## 📝 Assignments Overview

### 1️⃣ Assignment 1: Unauthenticated Web APIs  
- Developed **public APIs** that do not require authentication.
- Implemented **CRUD operations** using REST principles.
- Ensured **efficient data handling** and **error management**.
- Used the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture for structured API design.

### 2️⃣ Assignment 2: Authenticated Web APIs  
- Integrated **authentication and authorization** mechanisms.
- Implemented **JWT-based security** for user access control.
- Enhanced API security with **role-based access**.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **C# / .NET Core**
- **Entity Framework**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **RESTful API principles**

## 📂 File Structure
The project consists of two main directories, A1 and A2, representing different assignments.

### A1 (Assignment 1)
- **Controllers/** - Handles API requests and responses.
- **Data/** - Database-related files and configurations.
- **Dtos/** - Data Transfer Objects.
- **Migrations/** - Database migration files.
- **Models/** - Defines database models.
- **appsettings.json** - Application configuration settings.
- **Program.cs** - The main entry point.

### A2 (Assignment 2)
Same structure as A1, with additional:
- **Handler/** - Contains request handlers.
- **Helper/** - Utility functions for common tasks.
- **A2Template.generated.cs** - Template-related C# file.

This structure ensures modularity and maintainability of the RESTful API project.

## 📌 Notes
This project demonstrates essential **backend development skills** in C# by building **secure and scalable APIs**. The assignments highlight best practices in API design, authentication, and database interactions.
